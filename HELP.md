To build project please use command "mvn clean install"

You can run project from IDE (main class is "SurveyApplicationStarter") or from command line:
from target folder:
java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Please use this link to open launched project - http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

You have to create question data firstly, then add answer data to existed question.

Swagger UI will help during test.

Thanks.
